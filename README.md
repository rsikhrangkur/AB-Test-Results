# Analyze A/B Test Results
### Ryan Sikhrangkur

This project covers the steps into using data analysis to explore A/B test results, and was completed for the purpose of completing Udacity's data analysis nanodegree program.

The files included for this project are:
> ab_data.csv - the primary source of information for the project.
> countries.csv - the countries from which trials in the ab_data.csv file are assigned, and added to the project to ensure the test results are free of bias.
> Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb - the Jupyter notebook in which I have worked through the steps as detailed.
> Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.html - an HTML format of the notebook for presentation and project submission.

The project is heavily detailed in a step-by-step process for using the provided information to see results of the A/B testing. All steps are provided by Udacity, while the code and summaries are mine.
